My email is "admin", followed by the "at" symbol, followed by the name of this website, jaiden.dev. My PGP key is available [here](pgp.asc).

I am open to work! Contact me for a copy of my resume.

Spammers like to automatically scrape websites for email addresses they can send unsolicited emails to. I can't afford a nice spam filter, so I have to obfuscate my email address in a way only humans can understand.
