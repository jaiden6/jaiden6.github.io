Hi! I'm Jaiden. I'm a fan of cybersecurity, programming, chess, and photography. I made this website to showcase my projects and record my growth as a person. You can contact me [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSco_eK-DtPA2-ZW-K1XIiBNkzEZru16JWwGbteuUAlQgEt6fw/viewform).

This website was converted from ugly Markdown files into beautiful HTML and CSS using the [Moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
